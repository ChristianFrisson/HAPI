HAPI is a cross-platform, device independent easily extendable API that can be
used to add haptics to an application. For information on how you are allowed
to use HAPI see the LICENSE file in the same folder as this file.

This file contains complete installation instructions for Linux, Mac and Windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation on Linux:
Currently you need to build HAPI on Linux yourself. Since you have this file
you have already obtained and unpacked the source for HAPI. To build HAPI
on Linux follow these steps.

1. Install version 2.4.7 or later of CMake. To do this on Ubuntu open a
   terminal and write:
    sudo apt-get install cmake

2. HAPI depends on other libraries. These need to be installed if the feature
   is required. The build system used by HAPI will detect which libraries
   are installed on the system and only enable the features that the system can
   support. The libraries used by HAPI are:

   Required libraries. Without this HAPI will not function.
    - pthread. Most probably included with your linux distribution.

   Optional libraries, without these some features of HAPI will be disabled
   and some of the distributed examples will not work.
    - openGL, to support FeedbackBufferCollectorExample and features.
    - glut, used as the window system. Needed for
      FeedbackBufferCollectorExample.
    - freeglut, extended functions of the windows system. Needed for
      FeedbackBufferCollectorExample.
    - OpenHaptics, for support of devices from SensAble. Obtained through
      SensAble.
    - DHD-API, obtained through ForceDimension. libusb needs to be installed
      to compile DHD-API. PCISCAN_LIBRARY should also be set if the library
      is not found in default location.

   If using Ubuntu 7.10 or later, several of these libraries can be obtained
   by using the apt-get feature. In a terminal write:
    sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gcc g++ libglew-dev libglut \
    libglut3-dev alien

   The first two are the C++ compilers needed to compile HAPI.

   Freeglut can be obtained using the following commands:
    wget http://ovh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/freeglut/freeglut-2.4.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf freeglut-2.4.0.tar.gz
    cd freeglut-2.4.0
    ./configure CFLAGS="-fexceptions" CXXFLAGS="-fexceptions"
    make
    sudo make install

   HAPI support more devices but only the two mentioned are tested. See the wiki
   and/or manual for more information.

   To install libusb required by DHD-api from ForceDimension on Ubuntu do the
   following:
    sudo apt-get install libusb++-dev

3. In the terminal change folder to the HAPI/build folder. Write:
    cmake .
   This will generate a make file. To use the makefile write:
    make

   HAPI will be built. When the make finished write:
    sudo make install

   HAPI libraries are now installed on your system. But there is no
   application installed that use HAPI libraries.

4. There are example applications in this distribution that use HAPI. To build
   these simply do the following:
    Change folder to HAPI/examples.
    cmake .

   To test one of the examples do the following.
    Change folder to HAPI/examples/SurfaceExample/build
    ./SurfaceExample

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation on Windows:
To install HAPI on Windows follow these steps:
1. Download Windows installation file from www.h3d.org.
2. Install HAPI using this file.
3. Run examples through start menu.

For information on how to build HAPI on Windows see the pdf-manual
and/or the wiki.

Installation on Mac:
 - To be written.

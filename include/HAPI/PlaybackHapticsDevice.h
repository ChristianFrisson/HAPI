  ///        previously using a DeviceLog.
  /// 
  /// This haptics device plays back device values from a file. 
  /// The format of the file is the same as that produced
  /// by the DeviceLog force effect. Both binary and text formats are 
  /// supported.
  ///
  /// Any combination of columns are supported, however a TIME
  /// column is required in order to play back the values at the original
  /// speed.
  ///
  /// The following columns are used to define the device's raw values:
  /// RAW_POSITION, RAW_ORIENTATION, RAW_VELOCITY, BUTTONS. Any other 
  /// columns are ignored. The calibrated device values are calculated
  /// based on the raw values in the usual way and the recorded calibrated
  /// values (if present) are ignored.

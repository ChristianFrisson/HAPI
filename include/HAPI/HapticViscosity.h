  /// HapticViscosity uses stokes law to calculate the force
  /// exerted on a sphere of radius r in a fluid with a certain viscosity.
  /// The flow is assumed to be laminar. It will only be valid for fairly small
  /// values of viscosity and radius. Also the speed of the haptics device can
  /// not be to high. The algorithm is very simple all it does is calculating
  /// a force in the opposite direction of the velocity of the haptics device.

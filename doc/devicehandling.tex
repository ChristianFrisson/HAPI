\chapter {Device handling}
HAPI is device independent and can be used with a wide variety of haptics devices. The haptics devices currently supported by HAPI are:

\begin{itemize}
\item PHANToM Devices from SensAble Technologies ( implemented in the
  PhantomHapticsDevice class ) \cite{sensable}
\item Delta and Omega devices from ForceDimension ( implemented in the
  ForceDimensionHapticsDevice class ). \cite{forcedimension} 
\item Falcon from Novint ( implemented in the FalconHapticsDevice class ). \cite{novint} 
\item HapticMaster from Moog FCS Robotics( implemented in the HapticMasterDevice class ).\cite{moogfcs} \cite{linde02hapticmaster} 
\end{itemize}

Each of these devices has a special class implementing the interface to the device. These classes also provide device specific functions that can be used. Most of the time the user does not care what haptics device is used and can then use the AnyHapticsDevice class when specifying the haptics device instead. The AnyHapticsDevice class will try to find a haptics device to use by trying to initialize all the devices that are supported. The haptics devices used will be the first one that initializes successfully.

\section{Calibration}
By default the coordinates given by the haptics device classes are
given in metres in the local coordinate space of the haptics
device. Often this is not the coordinate system a user wants
though, and therefore HAPI provides a means to change the coordinate
system by adding a calibration matrix. The position given by the
getPosition() function will then be pos = matrix * orig\_pos. It is
also possible to calibrate the orientation and the result will be in
the same way, i.e. orn = orn\_calib * orig\_orn. In this case the
calibration value will not be a matrix, but a Rotation object.

\section{Layering}
When adding shapes to be rendered at the haptics device, one can
specify what ``layer'' in which it should be rendered. Each layer has
its own haptics rendering algorithm, which makes it possible to render
different shapes with different haptics rendering algorithms on one
haptics device. The resulting force will be the sum of the forces from
each layer as illustrated in figure \ref{Layering_fig}. A common use is,
for example in medical simulation, to
specify shapes for different tissue layers in different haptic
layers. For example, if rendering a hand, one might use one layer for
the skin and one layer for the bone of the hand. This will make it
possible to feel the hard bone through the soft skin. If the shapes
were specified in only one layer, the user would feel only the skin
geometry, since the proxy stays on the surface. Specifying the bone in
a second layer will add a new separate proxy for all the shapes in
that layer. See the functions in section \ref{ssHapticsRenderingFunctions} for
information on how to add shapes to a specific layer.

\begin{figure} 
  \centering 
  \includegraphics{images/layering2.pdf}
  \caption{To the right all surface are part of layer 0. The proxy is then stopped at the first surface and the
underlying surface will never be felt. To the left the two surfaces are put in two different layers which
each has its own proxy, which means it will be felt.} 
  \label{Layering_fig} 
\end{figure}

If no haptics rendering algorithm is specified for a layer, no forces
will be generated from that layer.
 
By default all operations use layer 0.

\section{The HAPIHapticsDevice abstract base class}
The HAPIHapticsDevice abstract base class is the base class for all
haptics device implementations. It contains the functions that are
available for all haptics devices.  The functions available can be divided into three categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Device handling functions.
\item Calibration functions.
\item Haptic rendering functions.
\end{itemize}

The device handling functions are for communication with the haptics device, such as initializing/deinitializing the device, reading positions and sending forces. 

The calibration functions lets the user manipulate the coordinate system the values of the haptics device are reported in.

The haptic rendering functions are used to define what to render on the haptics device, e.g. which effects, which shapes and what haptics renderer.

\subsection{Device handling functions}

Most common device handling functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item ErrorCode initDevice( int \_thread\_frequency = 1024 ) -  Does all the initialization needed for the
device before starting to use it.
\item ErrorCode releaseDevice() - Releases all resources that were allocated
in initDevice.
\item ErrorCode enableDevice() - Enabling the device means that the
positions and forces will be updated.  
\item ErrorCode disableDevice() - Stop the forces and position
from being updated, but does not release the device.
\item DeviceValues getDeviceValues() - Get a structure with all the
  device values that are recorded each frame (such as position,
  velocity,etc)
\item Vec3 getPosition() - Get the position of the haptics device (in
  m)
\item Vec3 getVelocity() - Get the velocity of the haptics device (in
  m/s)
\item Rotation getOrientation() - Get the orientation of the haptics
  device stylus (if 6 DOF input).
\item bool getButtonStatus( unsigned int button\_nr ) - get the status
  for a given button on the haptics device.
\end{itemize}

The ErrorCode returned for some of the above functions is an enumerator. The
returned code will be HAPI::HAPIHapticsDevice::SUCCESS on success.

\subsection{Calibration functions}
Following are the most commonly used functions for modifying the local
coordinate system the values of the haptics device are reported in.

\begin{itemize}
\item void setPositionCalibration( const Matrix4 \&m ) - Set the
 position calibration matrix
\item const Matrix4 \&getPositionCalibration() - Get the current
 position calibration matrix
\item void setOrientationCalibration( const Rotation \&r ) - Set the
  orientation calibration
\item const Rotation \&getOrientationCalibration() - Get the
  current orientation calibration
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Haptics rendering functions}
\label{ssHapticsRenderingFunctions}
Following are the most commonly used functions for changing what and
how to render objects with the haptics device. 

\begin{itemize} 

\item void setHapticsRenderer( HAPIHapticsRenderer *r, unsigned int
  layer = 0 ) - Set the haptics rendering algoritm to use for a
  specific layer on the haptics device

\item void addShape( HAPIHapticShape *shape, unsigned int layer = 0 )
  - Render a shape on the given layer. The shape will be rendered
  until removed.
\item void removeShape( HAPIHapticShape *shape, unsigned int layer = 0
  ) - Remove a shape currently being rendered.
\item void clearShapes( unsigned int layer = 0 ) - Remove all shapes
  on a layer. 

\item void addEffect( HAPIForceEffect *effect, HAPITime fade\_in\_time = 0 ) - Add a haptic
  effect to render by the haptics device. The effect will be rendered
  until removed.
\item void removeEffect( HapticForceEffect *effect, HAPITime fade\_out\_time = 0 ) - Remove a haptic
  effect currently being rendered.
\item void clearEffects() - Remove all haptic effects currently rendered.
\item void transferObjects() - Transfer the current objects to the haptics loop.
\end{itemize}

The above functions works at a temporary local copy of effects and
shapes. The haptics is rendered in a different loop and in order to
transfer the changes made to that loop the user has to call the
transferObjects() function. 

Example:

\input{examples/transfer_objects}

See the doxygen documentation for a full listing of the functions
available. 

\section{Example}
Following is an example on a simple program that initialize a haptics
device and sends a constant force of 1 N in the positive x-direction.

\input{examples/constant_force} 

\section{Adding support for new devices}
\label{ssAddingHapticsSupport}

Support for new devices can easily be added to HAPI by subclassing the
HAPIHapticsDevice class and implement the four abstract functions below.

\begin{itemize}
\item bool initHapticsDevice( int \_thread\_frequency = 1024 ) - initialize the haptics device. Return
  true on success, otherwise false and set an error message. 
\item bool releaseHapticsDevice() - releases all resources held by the
  haptics device. Return true on success, otherwise false and set an
  error message. 
\item void updateDeviceValues( DeviceValues \&dv, HAPITime dt ) - fill
  in the DeviceValues structures with the current values from the
  haptics device(values are e.g. position, velocity, etc). dt is the
  time in seconds since the last update.
\item void sendOutput( DeviceOutput \&dv, HAPITime dt ) - render the
  output given in the DeviceOutput structure (such as force and torque)
  on the haptics device. dt is the time in seconds since the last update.
\end{itemize}

Look at the PhantomHapticsDevice and ForceDimensionHapticsDevice classes for
example implementations. 

Also in order for your new device to be recognised by the
AnyHapticsDevice class, you will have to register the haptics device
to a database of available devices. This is done by adding the a
static member in your new class:

In header file:

\input{examples/hapticsDeviceRegistration_h}

In .cpp file:

\input{examples/hapticsDeviceRegistration_cpp}

The string given as first argument is the name of your new device. The second
argument is the function to use for creating a new instance of the device. The
third argument is a list of names of dll-s that need to exist on the system to
be able to start the device. This argument is only required for haptics devices
that should be supported in Microsoft Windows.

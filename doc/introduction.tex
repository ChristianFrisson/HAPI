\section{What is HAPI?}
HAPI is an open-source, cross-platform, haptics rendering engine written entirely in C++. It is device-independent and supports multiple currently available commercial haptics devices. You can write your application once and not have to modify any code to use another haptics device
 Choose between different rendering algorithms, different force effects
 and several kinds of surfaces to create the feeling that you want or create your own custom made effects. HAPI has been design to be highly modular and easily extended.

\section{What is HAPI?}
HAPI is an open-source, cross-platform, haptics rendering engine. HAPI is
written entirely in C++ and works with several commercial haptics devices.
 Choose between different rendering algorithms, different force effects
 and several kind of surfaces. If you miss your force effect, surface or device
 simply add it yourself.

Changes for version 1.0 beta 1:

- Build files for different systems are no longer provided. They should be
generated through CMake. www.cmake.org. The CMakeLists.txt used for this
can be found in the build folder.
- Surfaces can be specified to use stiffness relative to the maximum force that
the device can handle.
- Support for multiple falcon devices. Requires latest version of HDAL.
- Added function movingSphereIntersect which is like the old one but returns
information about closest intersection.
- Standardized render functions of CollisionObjects.
- When initializing a haptics device a desired haptic rate can be given. The
actual values that can be used depends on the haptics device.
- Added and updated examples.
- HAPIForceEffects no longer have the interpolate member. Interpolation (if desired)
are done when adding/removing forces to/from the haptics device. Need to call
transferObjects function for HAPIForceEffects now.
- Header files moved to separate directory to make it into the standard
way for include files.
- A couple of HAPIHapticsShape classes are merged into one class called
HapticPrimitive. One or two of these classes are removed.
- Velocity calculated for devices. Damping property added to surfaces.
- Reference counting are now thread safe, this can be shut off for custom made
classes if desired.
- Fixed compile issues with linux.
- HAPI now uses m instead of mm.
- Added virtual function getTangentSpaceMatrix for GeometryPrimitive and
HAPIHapticsShape. Can be used to get transformation from coordinate space to
texture space.
- All haptics device and haptics renderers classes now report correct values.
- Fixed a number of bugs in GodObjectRenderer and RuspiniRenderer.
- Separated proxy movement and force generation calculations for surfaces.
- Fixed a couple of major bugs with OpenHapticsRenderer and
PhantomHapticsDevice.
- Optimized code in various places.
- Fixed bugs with surfaces that caused really bad surface generation in
the alpha release.
- Fixed a lot of minor bugs. See svn changelog at www.h3d.org:8080 for details.

New Classes:
DepthMapSurface
HAPIVariableDepthSurface
HapticPrimitive
ImageInterfaceObject

Compability issues:
- OnConctact function in HAPISurfaceObject is split into two functions
called getProxyMovement and getForces.
- Units in m now. Used to be mm.
- namespace HAPI::Bounds renamed to HAPI::Collision.
- HapticBox, HapticPlane, HapticSphere and HapticTriangle removed since
HapticPrimitive can be used instead.
- HapticCone and HapticCylinder removed.
- Renamed HapticBinaryTreePrimitive to HapticPrimitiveTree.
- Header files moved to include/HAPI. Include them with HAPI/ prefix. Note that
file for OpenHapticsRenderer are in OpenHapticsRenderer/include/HAPI and files
for Chai3DRenderer are in Chai3DRenderer are in Chai3DRenderer/include/HAPI.
H3DUtil files should have the H3DUtil/ prefix when including.
- The transferObjects function must be called to transfer HAPIForceEffects to
the haptics loop, as it was intended earlier to, but not needed.
- The render function in BinaryBoundTree and BBPrimitiveTree now render the 
primitives in the tree. Outlines are rendered in renderBounds function.
- calculateForces takes an EffectInput struct as argument instead of several
arguments. Note, this will only be a problem when upgrading from alpha to beta.
H3D API 1.5 had this struct.
- On Windows, some external libraries are moved around. This might cause
problem with old project files but will not cause problems for project
generated through CMake.
